APPLICATION DEADLINE  Applications will be accepted on-line only from MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2018 THROUGH FRIDAY, JUNE 29, 2018.  In accordance with Civil Service Rule 4.2, all applicants who apply may not be tested in this examination. To meet anticipated hiring needs, stratified random sampling of qualified applicants who passed the FCA will be invited to participate in the interview. Stratified random sampling may occur periodically and as needed, based on the City's hiring needs. Applications submitted during the filing period will be kept on file and will automatically be included for consideration during the stratified random sampling process under this job bulletin.  Candidates will be notified by e-mail of the specific date, time, and location of the interview. Interviews are anticipated to begin after the end of the application filing period.  SELECTION PROCESS  After meeting minimum qualifications, and in accordance with Rule 4.2 as stated above, candidates will be scheduled for the following:  Examination Weight: Interview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%  The examination process consists of the following steps.   1. The INTERVIEW is a behavior-based review of a candidate's personal history. It is designed to evaluate initiative in learning, practical orientation, role adaptability, service orientation, oral communication skills, job motivation, teamwork, and respect for diversity. The minimum passing score is 70. This score will determine a candidate's rank on the eligible list, which is valid for one year from the date of the interview. This is an extremely competitive examination and a sufficient number of candidates with the highest scores will continue in the selection process. 2. Based on a candidate's ranking on the eligible list and the hiring needs of the Fire Department, candidates with the highest scores will be selected for a BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. The background investigation will consist of a background appointment and field investigation. The background investigation is conducted to evaluate: interpersonal skills, sensitivity, and respect for others; decision-making and judgment; maturity and discipline; honesty, integrity, and personal ethics; setting and achieving goals; and a records check. 3. A MEDICAL EXAMINATION is conducted by a City physician to evaluate the candidate's medical fitness (vision, hearing, cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.) to perform the full range of Firefighter duties, with no conditions which would affect the candidate's ability to safely perform those duties. 4. A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION (including written tests, and possibly an interview by a City Psychologist) is conducted to evaluate the candidate's psychological fitness to safely perform the full range of Firefighter duties.  ADDITIONAL JOB INFORMATION  Candidate Advancement Program (CAP): Candidates selected in the stratified random sampling and who move forward in the selection process after the interview will be required to complete the CAP Fitness Assessment. The CAP Fitness Assessment results are advisory. Candidates will also be required to maintain the CAP Fitness Assessment Logbook throughout the field investigation.  The CAP Fitness Assessment Logbook must be completed by the conclusion of the field investigation.    After the field investigation is conducted, a REVIEW OF QUALIFICATIONS will be completed by representatives from the Fire Department, which may include a department interview. This review may include the evaluation of the candidate's training, experience, personal qualifications, and findings of the background investigation as they prepared the candidate for the job of Firefighter. Based on hiring needs, those candidates with the strongest qualifications will receive a conditional job offer from the Fire Department and be scheduled for the medical and psychological evaluation. This is an extremely competitive examination and there are relatively few positions to be filled. Based on this, not all candidates reviewed will be selected for further processing.  PHYSICAL: Firefighting and medical rescue work is physically demanding.  Candidates must be in excellent health and have no conditions which would restrict their ability to safely perform fire suppression and rescue work.  Weight (body fat content) must be proportionate to height.   VISION: Uncorrected distance visual acuity of at least 20/100 in the poorer eye and 20/40 in the better eye, correctable to at least 20/40 in one eye and 20/20 in the other eye is required.  Regarding refractive surgery, most persons who have had these procedures will be passed.  However, some may be deferred for several months or disqualified based on an individualized assessment of the surgical outcome.  Regarding color vision, candidates must be able to accurately and quickly name colors and be free of other visual impairments that would restrict their ability to perform Firefighter duties.  TOBACCO: Firefighters are required to refrain from all use of tobacco throughout their employment with the Los Angeles Fire Department.  DRUG & ALCOHOL SCREENING: A drug and alcohol screening test may be required at any time prior to appointment because Firefighter has been designated as a safety sensitive class.  NOTES:  1.

In the qualifying written test, which will consist of multiple-choice questions, the following competencies may be evaluated: Judgment and Decision Making, Analytical Ability, Customer Service, Written Communication, and Job Knowledge, including knowledge of: State policies as they apply to workers' compensation benefits; mandatory benefit notices, payment methods, reimbursement requirements, collection agencies, and lien claimants; the California State Labor Code, including relevant regulations and legal decisions; Appellate and Supreme Court decisions related to matters such as injuries/illnesses incurred to and from the place of employment, employees' rights to Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit (SJDB), employers' right to subrogation and apportionment; the Rules of the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB); medical and anatomical terminology; the Permanent Disability Rating System; the Independent Medical Review (IMR), Utilization Review (UR), and Independent Bill Review (IBR) rules, regulations, and procedures as set forth by the Department of Industrial Relations Medical Unit; utilization review processes and guidelines; and other necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities.   On the same day as the qualifying written test, candidates will be required to prepare some written material in response to a problem related to the duties and responsibilities of a Workers' Compensation Analyst.  This essay material will not be separately scored, but will be presented to the interview panel for discussion with the candidate and for consideration in the overall evaluation of the candidates' qualifications. Those who do not complete the advisory essay will not be invited to the interview and will be considered to have failed the entire examination.   Passing Score for Qualifying Written Test   The passing score for the qualifying written test will be determined by Personnel Department staff after the qualifying written test is administered. Consideration will be given to the number of candidates taking the test and the existing and anticipated number of vacancies, such that there are a sufficient number of eligibles on the list to satisfy current and future vacancies for the next two years. Therefore, the passing score for the qualifying multiple-choice written may be set either above or below 70%.  Candidates must achieve a passing score on the qualifying multiple-choice test and must complete the advisory essay, in order to be invited to the interview.   The examination score will be based entirely on the interview. In the interview, the following competencies may be evaluated: Judgment and Decision Making, Analytical Ability, Conscientiousness, Stress Tolerance, Fact Finding, Customer Service, Oral Communication, Written Communication, and Job Knowledge, including knowledge of: the California State Labor Code, including relevant regulations and legal decisions; the Permanent Disability Rating System; a variety of workers' compensation information sources; the Independent Medical Review (IMR), Utilization Review (UR), and Independent Bill Review (IBR) rules, regulations, and procedures as set forth by the Department of Industrial Relations Medical Unit; utilization review processes and guidelines; principles and best practices related to early return to work programs and the evaluation of work restrictions; the principles related to agreed to medical examiners (AME)/qualified medical examiners (QME)/Panel QME processes and protocols, time frames and processing; and other necessary skills, knowledge, and abilities.
